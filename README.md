DR. Nava Eslami Fundamentals of Natural Language Processing class for undergraduates - Term:4031 - IAU NTB
\nTA : Mr. Sina Tamjid Shabestari

Exercise 1 (Tamrin aval): 
For the English text below, do the following.
1. Lemmatization
2. Three tokenize methods of your choice
3. Three stemming methods of your choice
Note: There are words in the text that may not be stemmed well.
Try to use methods that recognize correctly as much as possible.
English text:

"Technology is advancing rapidly, changing the way we communicate, work, and live. Many companies are adopting new strategies to improve efficiency and reduce costs. Employees are encouraged to develop their skills and adapt to evolving roles. Innovations such as artificial intelligence and machine learning are transforming industries. However, some challenges remain. Workers are sometimes worried about job security, as automation can replace certain tasks. Ultimately, adapting to these changes is crucial for personal and professional growth."

Exercise 2:
Performing text-classification on a dataset you found yourself.

Step 1: Search the internet and download a dataset for text-classification.

Step 2: After finding the dataset, implement the classification using the methods I taught in the session.

Note: You can also use other methods such as naive bayes and svm, but do not use ready-made models from other packages and try to choose a small dataset because you do not need much data for this task.

Final step: After finishing your cartoon, send me only three things.

1. Your code notebook file
2. Dataset file
3. The link to the site from which you downloaded the dataset.

Note: Your file must be in the form of a notebook, which you must do inside the Google Colab space and send me the file with the extension .ipynb. Do not send the Google Colab link, send the file itself.

The data set should not be taken by artificial intelligence and you should search for the data set yourself.

The deadline for submitting the project is December 11th. Please do not leave it for the last night. I may not be able to access the PC. Please ask any questions you have before the delivery date in these two weeks.

Exercise 3:
Performing Sentiment Analysis on a Dataset You Found Yourself

Step 1: Search the Internet and download a dataset for Sentiment Analysis.

Step 2: After finding the dataset, implement Sentiment Analysis using any model you want and found (supervise), or the model I taught in the session.

Note: You cannot use transformer models!! And try to use a dataset that is neither too small nor too large.

Final Step: After finishing your work, send me only three things.

1. Your code notebook file
2. Dataset file in csv format
3. The link to the site from which you downloaded the dataset.

Note: Your file must be in the form of a notebook, which you must do inside Google Colab and send me the file with the extension .ipynb. Do not send the Google Colab link, send the file itself.

The data set should not be taken by artificial intelligence and you should search for the data set yourself and the data set in the video should not be selected. Be sure to pay attention to this issue.

The deadline for submitting the project is December 16th. Please do not leave it for the last night. I may not be able to access the PC. If you have any problems, ask them before the delivery day in these few weeks.
